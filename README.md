# j3-j

Animating blocks and spheres to make cubes using blender python.
The mathematics behind the symmetry is beautiful!  The 'j-cubed minus j' expression for any cube of edge length 'j' is always divisible by 6, for example a cube with edge length 7 will give the result 343 - 7 = 336.

It is then up to the imagination to find attractive ways to form and animate blocks to fill the space surrounding unit spheres occupying the long diagonal (top back left corner to bottom front right) within each cube.

Coded in Blender 2.91.2.
