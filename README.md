# j3-j

Uses Blender Python to animate blocks and spheres that make 3D puzzle cubes.  My site https://j3-j.com has images and links including an Etsy shop.

The mathematics behind the three dimensional symmetry is beautiful!  For example, the 'j-cubed minus j' expression for any cube of edge length 'j' is always divisible by 6 (for example a cube with edge length 7 will give the result 343 - 7 = 336) which enables simpler solutions using rotational and  reflective symmetry. 

The next steps is to discover and calculate ways to form and then animate blocks to fill the space surrounding the unit spheres occupying the long diagonal, top back left corner to bottom front right corner, to completely fill the cube.
